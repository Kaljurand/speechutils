Speechutils is an Android library that helps to implement apps that need to include speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.
For example, it provides methods for

- audio recording and encoding
- aggregating speech-to-text and text-to-speech services
- playing audio cues before/after speech-to-text
- pausing the background audio during speech-to-text
